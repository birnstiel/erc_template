Performance obligations of the \textit{applicant legal entity} that will become the beneficiary of the H2020 ERC Grant Agreement (hereafter referred to as the Agreement), should the proposal be retained and the preparation of the Agreement be successfully concluded:\\

The \textit{applicant legal entity} commits itself to hosting [\textit{and engaging}] the \textit{principal investigator} for the duration of the grant to:

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item ensure that the work will be performed under the scientific guidance of the \textit{principal investigator} who is expected to devote:

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$-$}
\item \textit{in the case of a Starting Grant at least 50\% of her/his
total working time} to the ERC-funded project (action) and spend at
least 50\% of her/his total working time in an EU Member State or
associated country;
\item \textit{in the case of a Consolidator Grant at least 40\% of
her/his total working time} to the ERC-funded project (action) and spend
at least 50\% of her/his total working time in an EU Member State or
associated country;
\item \textit{in the case of an Advanced Grant at least 30\% of
her/his total working time} to the ERC-funded project (action) and spend
at least 50\% of her/his total working time in an EU Member State or
associated country.
\end{itemize}

\item carry out the work to be performed, as it will be identified in Annex 1 of the Agreement, taking into consideration the specific role of the \textit{principal investigator};
\item enter --- before signature of the Agreement --- into a `\textit{supplementary agreement}' with the \textit{principal investigator}, that specifies the obligation of the \textit{applicant legal entity} to meet its obligations under the Agreement;
\item provide \textit{the principal investigator} with a copy of the signed Agreement;
\item guarantee the \textit{principal investigator's} scientific independence, in particular for the:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item use of the budget to achieve the scientific objectives;
    \item authority to publish as senior author and invite as co-authors those who have contributed substantially to the work;
    \item preparation of scientific reports for the project (action);
    \item selection and supervision of the other \textit{team members} (hosted \textit{[and engaged]} by the \textit{applicant legal entity} or other legal entities), in line with the profiles needed to conduct the research and in accordance with the \textit{applicant legal entity's} usual management practices;
    \item possibility to apply independently for funding;
    \item access to appropriate space and facilities for conducting the research;
\end{enumerate}
\item provide --- during the implementation of the project (action) --- research support to the \textit{principal investigator} and the team members (regarding infrastructure, equipment, access rights, products and other services necessary for conducting the research);
\item support the \textit{principal investigator} and provide administrative assistance, in particular for the:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item general management of the work and his/her team
    \item scientific reporting, especially ensuring that the team members send their scientific results to the \textit{principal investigator};
    \item financial reporting, especially providing timely and clear financial information;
    \item application of the \textit{applicant legal entity's} usual management practices;
    \item general logistics of the project (action);
    \item access to the electronic exchange system (see Article 52 of the Agreement);
\end{enumerate}
\item inform the \textit{principal investigator} immediately (in writing) of any events or circumstances likely to affect the Agreement (see Article 17 of the Agreement);
\item ensure that the \textit{principal investigator} enjoys adequate:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item conditions for annual, sickness and parental leave;
    \item occupational health and safety standards;
    \item insurance under the general social security scheme, such as pension rights;
\end{enumerate}
\item allow the transfer of the Agreement to a new beneficiary (`portability'; see Article 56a of the Agreement).
\item take all measures to implement the principles set out in the Commission Recommendation on the European Charter for Researchers and the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers\footnote{Commission Recommendation 2005/251/EC of 11 March 2005 on the European Charter for Researchers and on a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (OJ L 75, 22.3.2005, p. 67).} - in particular regarding working conditions, transparent recruitment processes based on merit and career development -- and ensure that the \textit{principal investigator}, researchers and third parties involved in the project (action) are aware of them.
